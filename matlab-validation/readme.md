DSVerifier Validation

In order to reproduce all counterexamples in MATLAB, some scripts were developed to run and check automatically the reproduction of dsverifier counterexamples.

Configuration:

* Required tools to run the scripts: Linux/MATLAB;

Steps to run the validation:

1) Define a variable called 'path' in MATLAB workspace with the directory path of all counterexamples (e.g. .out files generated) returned by DSVerifier.

examples: 
path = '/home/user/dsverifier/couterexamples'

* this folder must have all .out files generated by DSVerifier.

2) Call the function 'dsv_validation'
>> dsv_validation();
or
>> dsv_validation;

3) Wait for the feedback validation. The files generated by validation are organized at 'outputs' directory and you'll find some files such as:

* dsv_counterexample_parameters: with all parameters extracted from .out counterexamples;
* dsv_counterexamples_outputs: with all outputs extracted from .out counterexamples;
* dsv_matlab_filter_outputs: with all outputs generated by filter function provided by MATLAB;
* dsv_matlab_model_outputs: with all outputs generated by simulink models runned by MATLAB;

You can use this files to check and verify the outputs validation if you want.

4) Validation Results:
* after run dsv_validation command on MATLAB workspace, you can see a feedback provided by MATLAB like:

Teste-1 Status: Wrong
Teste-2 Status: Correct
Teste-3 Status: Correct
Teste-4 Status: Wrong

* There are two status: wrong or correct. The correct status is called when the results between MATLAB and DSVerifier are the same. The wrong status is called when there are differences  between results from MATLAB and DSVerifier.
* You need to check in 'outputs' if the results generated by MATLAB are OK. If something presets some discrepancy, maybe you should investigate more accurately.

MATLAB Scripts:

There are 4 scripts developed to run the validation step by step:

1) dsv_extraction: extract all parameters from counterexamples folder;
2) dsv_parser: transform all parameters in variables on MATLAB workspace;
3) dsv_simulation: call simulink and run all counterexamples;
4) dsv_comparison: comparison between MATLAB and DSVerifier outputs;

All this scripts are called in dsv_validation and run all this steps automatically.

In dsv_extraction, some shell scripts are called in order to manipulate strings and get the parameters required to validation. The scripts are organized in shell-scripts directory.

The MATLAB models are implemented in DFI, DFII and TDII realization. All models are organized in model-simulink folder.
