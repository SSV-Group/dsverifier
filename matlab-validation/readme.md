#DSVerifier Validation

In order to reproduce all counterexamples in MATLAB, some scripts were developed to run and check automatically the reproduction of dsverifier counterexamples.

##Configuration:

* Required tools to run the scripts: Linux/MATLAB;

##Steps to run the validation:

Precondition:

You need to have a directory with all counterexamples (i.e. .out files) generated by DSVerifier.

examples: 
path = '/home/user/dsverifier/couterexamples'

* this folder must have all .out files generated by DSVerifier.

1) Call the function **'dsv_validation'**

*>> dsv_validation(path,p);*

**path** is the directory with all counterexamples and **p** is the property to be validated. It could be:
* 'm': for Minimum Phase Validation;
* 's': for Stability Validation;
* 'o': for Overflow Validation;
* 'lc': for Limit Cycle Validation.

2) Wait for the feedback validation. The files generated by validation are organized at 'outputs' directory and you'll find some files such as:

* dsv_counterexample_parameters: with all parameters extracted from .out counterexamples;

You can use this files to check and verify the outputs validation if you want.

3) .MAT File:
You can see all counterexamples extracted from .out files as variables in MATLAB. The counterexamples are organized as a group of structs.

##MATLAB Results:
After you run the automatic validation, a .MAT file is generated with all counterexamples extracted and their results from validation: Successful or Failed.

* Successful: this means that the validation is OK;
* Failed: the validation done by MATLAB has a different result of DSVerifier.

You can check the counterexamples saved in .MAT file either, it's implemented and organized as a group of structs with informations about the digital system, implementation, inputs, outputs, realization, word length, dynamical range and sample time.

##MATLAB Scripts:

There are 4 scripts developed to run the validation step by step:

1. **dsv_extraction**: extract all parameters from counterexamples folder;
2. **dsv_parser**: transform all parameters in variables on MATLAB workspace;
3. **dsv_simulation**: call realization scripts and run all counterexamples;
4. **dsv_comparison**: comparison between MATLAB and DSVerifier outputs.

All these scripts are called in **dsv_validation** and run all this steps automatically.

In dsv_extraction, some shell scripts are called in order to manipulate strings and get the parameters required to validation. The scripts are organized in **shell-scripts** directory.

The MATLAB models are implemented as scripts in **DFI, DFII and TDFII** realization.
